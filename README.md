# Employee-Tracker-CMS

## Description
This application is designed to be an employee tracker content management system(CMS). The application is designed to run within the user's terminal using the Node JavaScript. Once initialized the user will be given a set of questions that asks them whether they want to view and add employees, departments, and roles. Other functions include deleting employes, departments, and roles. The information will be dynamically updated on the user's terminal, and the user has the option to view any information they have updated at any time. I was inspired to build this project to give business owners the ability to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees of their company so they can organize and plan their business. This CMS application utilizes MySQL, Express.JS and Node.JS. 

## Installation

To open this environment, here are the steps needed:

1. Open Terminal
2. Make a new directory titled "employee-tracker-cms" (ensure you are in the location on your computer where you want the repo to be)
3. In GitHub, click the green 'Code' button and copy the HTTPS link
4. In Terminal, type "git clone" then paste the copied link and hit enter
5. Once cloned, check the status of the cloning by navigating to the directory where the repo is located and typing "git status"
6. If green, then the repo has been cloned and you can then drag the folder from your computer into vscode to run the environment

## Usage 
You may use this to view and add employees to a database. In order to run the application, you must input INDEX.JS within your terminal. Upon starting the application, you are shown options to view employees, view departments, view roles, add employees, add roles, add departments and delete these categories. Once selecting "View ALL Employees", all of the employees are shown within the database along with their names, title, department, salary, and manager. If you want to view employees by department, there is an option to have that be shown. You can also view all departments and roles which will show specific information relating to those categories. If any delete function is selected, the user inputed value will be deleted from the database.
